        <div id="div1" class="panel">Once upon a time there were two kingdoms that were the worst of neighbors.</div>
        <div id="div2" class="panel">So vast was the discord between them that it was said only a great hero or a terrible villain might bring them together.</div>
        <div id="div3" class="panel">In one kingdom lived folk like you and me with a vain and greedy king to rule over them.</div>
        <div id="div4" class="panel">They were forever discontent and envious of the wealth and beauty of their neighbors. For in the other kingdom, the Moors lived every manner of strange and wonderful creature.</div>
        <div id="div5" class="panel">And they needed neither king nor queen but trusted in one another. In a great tree on a great cliff in the Moors lived one such spirit. You might take her for a girl. But she was not just any girl, she was a fairy.</div>
